# Frontend Environment Variables

# For local development (connects to local backend):
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001

# For production deployment on Netlify (update with your Railway backend URL):
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-service.railway.app

# Note: 
# - Local .env file uses localhost for development
# - Production uses Netlify environment variables (set in Netlify dashboard)
# - Don't commit production URLs to .env files
